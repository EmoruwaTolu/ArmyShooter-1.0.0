# ArmyShooter-1.0.0
****EACH '-' makes reference to individual talking points about the code****

- This is the first version of Army Shooter made by Tolu Emoruwa. Rennes is the only functioning level as of now. 
- Currently the level does not end but it keeps track of the player stats. 
- The cursor will need to be changed to have a transparent background.
- The file game was developed using Visual Studio C# 2010 Express, but I have been having trouble migrating it to a newer software, as I have changed
  Operating Systems from Windows to macOS.
- The next version that will be released hopefully will have been migrated onto the newer Visual Studio program.
- The problem of it running on Macbooks is likely to still exist however, as the program makes use of 'Forms' that do not seem to be compatible with 
  the macOS.
- A level conclusion for Rennes will hopefully be made shortly after.
- A .png files containig screenshots of what the program is meant to look like when ran are included in the repository.(WhenRennesOpened)
